N-Layer Architecture Project
This project demonstrates a 4-layer architecture using OOP principles. The layers are structured as follows:

```
EntityLayer
↓
Data Access Layer (DAL)
↓
Logic Layer
↓
Presentation Layer
```


Layers:

EntityLayer: Defines the entities (data models).

Data Access Layer (DAL): Handles the database operations.

Logic Layer: Contains business logic.

Presentation Layer: Provides the user interface.
